# Mastering the Navigation #

You can navigate in many ways. The most common way is using the keyboard.

### Navigation Keys and default behaviours: ###

* **Down Key** goes to the next page or shows up the next fragment (we’ll see this later).
* **Up Key** goes to the previous page or hides the fragment.
* **Right Key** goes to the adjacent page in the next section <span class="small">(if available, it’s like a grid, otherwise it goes to the last page in the next section).</span>
* **Left Key** goes to the adjacent page in the previous section.

# Alternate Navigation Control #

Pressing the **Shift Key** you can alternate the the default navigation keys behaviour; let’s see how:

* **Down Key** goes to the next page skipping all the fragments.
* **Up Key** goes to the previous page skipping all the fragments.
* **Right Key** goes to the first page in the next section.
* **Left Key** goes to the first page in the previous section.

# Some Other Keys #

Because: the more, the better.

* **Page Up Key** goes to the first page of the current section.
* **Page Down Key** goes to the last page of the current section.
* **Home Key** goes to the first page of the first section.
* **End Key** goes to the last page of the last section.
